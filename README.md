# 🧴 EASI Score Calculator – R Shiny App

This R Shiny app calculates the **Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)**, a standardized tool used by dermatologists to evaluate the severity of eczema (atopic dermatitis). It is designed to support clinical use in both research and real-world settings.

## 🧠 Purpose

This tool simplifies the manual process of computing EASI scores by providing a clean, responsive interface where users can input severity ratings and affected areas by region:

- Head/Neck
- Trunk
- Upper Limbs
- Lower Limbs

It is **fully mobile- and tablet-optimized**, allowing **doctors and research staff** to calculate EASI scores during in-person assessments without needing a desktop setup.
